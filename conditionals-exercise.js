/* 
    Fortune Teller Machine Project
        (Comp Sci / Programming concept: Control Flow) -> 
            Control Flow: The order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls are executed or evaluated.
    
    Goal: Create a program that spits out a random fortune everytime you run it. The program should accept a username and include it 
        in the fortune (to personalize the message) ie: "Hello Tefe Del Rosario-Bell, your future is looking kinda bleak my friend."

        How do I do this?
        - Create a random number.
        - Create a control flow (if..else statements) to determine what is logged to the console, based on that random number.
        - Definitely feel free to get creative.

let randomNum = 33 
let randomNum1 = 20 




if(randomNum = 33){
    console.log("I finally got it right!");
} else{


    console.log("Nope")
}

if(randomNum1<=33){
    console.log("your on the right path");
}else {
    console.log()
}
let username = ("lucian")
    console.log(username)
