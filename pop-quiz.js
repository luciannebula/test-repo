//1.)There are 3 javascript keywords to initialize a variable. create A new variable below called value and set it to an empty string
let dog =  "KODA"
const value = "pets"
//2.)JavaScript has many data types. String is an example of one. Name 2 more
Number[0], Boolean = truthy, falsy
//3.)Evaluate the following statements: [What would this line of code return in my console]
//Don't run these exact line of code! [anything close is allowed]
    //4A.) console.log("4" + 4) = four plus 4 
    //4B.) console.log("4" * 4)
    //4C.) console.log("4" == 4)
    //4D.) console.log("Tefe".indexOf("E"))
    // 4E.) console.log("Javascript Is Fun".split(" "))

//4.)Write a function that takes an array as input and console logs each element in the array
const peopleInClass = [ "Shaundel Crumpton", "Lucian Bryan", "Johnnaibys Nunez", "Bayley Arens"]; 
console.log(peopleInClass)
//5.) Which of the following statements is not true about for loop statement:

    //A.) You can declare a variable in a for loop
    //B.) You can't make an infinite loop in a for loop = 
    B is false 
    //C.) You can exit out of a for loop with the break keyword
    //D.) For loops can increment upwards dowards or even not at all  //ask for clarifcation if this is confusing you


//6.) Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the average of all the numbers
function averagebox(array){
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        arr[i] = 
    }   
    console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5,])
//7.) You are given a dataset where you have nested arrays of information and you need to sort through all that information to sum up all the numbers.

function sum_array(arr) {
  

  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    
    for (var j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
      
 
      sum += arr[i][j];
      

const matrix = [[1,2,[4,55],[41,455],[525,525,[13,567,96,33]],[45,4145,682]]]

    //7A.) There are two potential 1 word answers for the name the approach you need to take to solve this problem. Name either one [ First one starts with I, Second one starsts with R ]
    //7B.) In 1-2 sentances explain high level [like if you were explaining to a 5 year old] what your approach to solving this would be.
